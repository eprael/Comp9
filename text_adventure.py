# Evan's House of Horrors
# Program and storyline by Evan Prael
# Date: 1/20/2023
# Description: This program is a text-based adventure game.  The user is transported to a dark basement
#              and must try to escape.  Traps at every turn can end the game quickly.
#              There are 3 rooms to get through. Each room has its own set of options and a hint.
#              A player can also quit any time.
#
# Program written with A LOT OF HELP from Github CoPilot, especially 
#   - all the screen functions (coloring, positioning, clearing, etc.)
#   - many of the descriptions for all the rooms
#   - the main play_room function almost wrote itself, but I did have to tweak it quite a bit
#   - code for accessing or looping throug the data collection

# Tested in Visual Studio Code for Windows

# Answer Key to reach the end:
# 4. Flick the switch
# 2. Open the Steel Door
# 4. Explore the bookshelf
# 2. Pickup the red book
# 2. Go up the stairs
# 5. Play the piano
# 1. Open the front door


# in the room data collection each room has a:
#   room id
#   room name
#   scene description
#   list of possible actions
#   hint for the player

# each action is made up of:
#   the action text
#   a message to display after the action
#   the room that the action leads to

# when running, the program 
#    displays an introduction
#    sets the room and the previous room's action message ("basement", "")
#    repeatedly calls the "play_room" function until the game is over

# the "play_room" function handles all activity for a room. 
# given a room_id and an action message from a previous room, it:
#
#   gets the room data from the room data collection 
#   displays the room name as a header 
#   displays the action message from the previous room, if there is one
#   displays the scene/room description
#   displays the list of available actions for that room, including the option to quit or get a hint
#   while there is no room change
#      prompts the user to make a selection (until selection is in range)
#      if the selection is 'q' (to quit), it returns with "player_quits"
#      if the selection is 'h' (hint), it displays the hint for the room
#      gets the action data from the room's action list for the selected action
#      if the action leads to a new room
#         returns the action's next room and action message
#      else 
#         displays the action's message and stays in the room

# Some actions lead to a new version of the same room.  
# This happens when a light is turned on or a box is opened 

# support for using ansii escape codes to print text in color
import os
os.system("")

# allows use of sleep function
import time

# allow for random prompts
